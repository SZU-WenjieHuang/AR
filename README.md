  ***Description:*** I was really impressed by the amazing effect of Microsoft Mesh and HoloLens. Unfortunately, I don't have a HoloLens yet, so I couldn't develop interactive mixed reality yet. Instead,I tried to deploy the AR model separately on Android and iOS. </p>
On Android, we have the option to choose between ARCore and Vuforia as our AR development platforms. Both platforms support device tracking, plane detection, face tracking, and 2D/3D object tracking. However, since ARCore does not support every Android device yet, I chose to use Vuforia for my project on Android. I deployed a 2D image tracking feature and added an animation of a model to the target image. </p>
  On IOS, I choose AR Foundation. It can support both ARKit and ARCore. AR Foundation has many Subsystems, such as XRSession, XRCamera, and Also XRImage. I deployed the most basic Devices Tracking on my ipad and can be found that if we need a better positioning effect, we still need to add 2D/3D Tracking. </p>
  I will upload files in Mac soon :)
